WORK IN PROGRESS
TerraXY is an opensource, small footprint, fast 3d printer inspired by panda-mini, SnakeOilXY, ratrig and Voron.
The goal was to maintain the 230x230mm build area of an ender-3 but to make it faster, more reliable and compact.
The cornerstones of the design are:
	- Only use off the shelf or 3d printed parts
 	- stay under 400 euro when stripping an ender 3 for parts or 500 when building from scratch

   Special thanks to Chip from the snakeoilxy and Vez3D from thr VZbot for answering some of my questions!
