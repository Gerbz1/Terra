TerraXY is an opensource, small footprint, fast 3d printer inspired by panda-mini, SnakeOilXY, ratrig and Voron. It was designed and built by me and Bart.
The goal was to maintain the 230x230mm build area of an ender-3 but to make it faster, more reliable and compact.
https://github.com/Gerbz1/TerraXY/blob/main/README.md
The cornerstones of the design are:
	- Only use off the shelf or 3d printed parts
 	- stay under 400 euro when stripping an ender 3 for parts or 500 when building from scratch

Special thanks to Chip and Vez3D for answering some of my questions, I really appreciate it!
